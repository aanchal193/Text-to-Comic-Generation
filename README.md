# Text to Comic Generator

The Text to Comic Generator uses advanced AI models to turn written stories into engaging comic strips. By understanding the details in the text and creating matching pictures, our system makes storytelling fun and immersive. We use the Mistral 7B model to understand the language and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) to create clear and accurate comic pictures. This makes sure the comics are high-quality, easy to understand, and fit well with the story.
